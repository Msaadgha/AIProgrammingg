This project involves creating an AI-driven trading bot that leverages **market sentiment analysis** and **technical indicators** to make informed trading decisions. By combining natural language processing (NLP) to assess public sentiment from news and social media with machine learning predictions and traditional trading strategies, the bot aims to enhance trading accuracy and profitability.

## Features:
- **Market Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time evaluation of public sentiment from financial news and social platforms.
- **Technical Indicators**: Integration of indicators like Moving Averages (SMA/EMA), RSI, and MACD.
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning models for stock trend predictions.
- **Automated Trading**: Decision-making pipeline for efficient trade execution.
